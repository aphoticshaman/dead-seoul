# DEAD SEOUL - Recursive Branch Roadmap

## Design Constraints
- Minimum 10-15 minutes reading to ANY ending (including death)
- Every choice branches (no convergence until very late, if ever)
- Show don't tell - visceral, sensory prose
- Each scene: 200-400 words + 2-4 choices

## Depth Calculation
- Average reading speed: 200-250 words/minute
- Target minimum: 10 minutes = 2000-2500 words per path
- At 300 words/scene = minimum 7-8 scenes to any ending
- Recommended: 10-12 scenes minimum depth

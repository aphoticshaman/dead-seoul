Let his weight lean into you.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Words are useless. Words can't fix the world. Words can't undo what he did to survive. What you'll both have to do.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">So you hold him. And he holds you. Two people in a small apartment while Seoul dies outside.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Time passes. The light changes. The fires spread.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Eventually, he pulls back. His eyes are red, but clear. Something has shifted. Settled.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"Okay,\" he says. Just that. Okay.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"Okay,\" you answer.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">He looks at you—really looks, for the first time since he arrived.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"You're still wearing my shirt. The one I left behind.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You'd forgotten. The oversized Oxford you stole from his side of the closet. Slept in it for weeks after he left. Still sleep in it now.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"It's comfortable.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"It looks better on you.\"</p>\n        ",

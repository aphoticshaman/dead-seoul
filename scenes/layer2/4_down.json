You don't look too closely at who.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The stairwell is dark. Emergency lights dead. Your phone flashlight cuts a small cone of reality into the black.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Fifteen floors down. Each landing a potential ambush. Your footsteps echo. Blood roars in your ears.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Third floor. A sound. Breathing. Heavy. Wet. Something in the shadows below.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You stop. It stops.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You shine the light down. Two flights below—a figure. Standing in the corner. Facing the wall. Shoulders moving with each ragged breath.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">It hasn't noticed you. Yet.</p>\n        ",

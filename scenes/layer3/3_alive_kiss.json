Six months of silence and grief and anger, all of it dissolving in the press of his lips against yours.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">He tastes like blood and smoke and fear. He tastes like the man you loved. Still love. Always loved, even when you hated him for leaving.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">When you break apart, you're both breathing hard. His forehead against yours. His hands on your waist.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'm sorry,\" he whispers. \"I'm sorry I left. I'm sorry I didn't ask you to come. I'm sorry for everything.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"I know.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"I should have stayed. Should have chosen you.

Apologize later. We need to move.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">He almost smiles. The first real expression since he walked through the door.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"There's my Yuna.\"</p>\n        ",

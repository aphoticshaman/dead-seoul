Gold band, worn thin by fifty-four years of wear. You can barely read the inscription inside: <em>T+S 1952</em></p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You hesitate. This feels wrong. Sacred. But—</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She wanted to be remembered. She wanted Taehyun to be remembered. Someone should carry their story forward.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You slip the ring onto a chain from her jewelry box. Hang it around your neck. The gold is cold against your chest.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'll tell them,\" you whisper. \"Someone will know you existed. Both of you.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Her face is peaceful. You choose to believe she heard.</p>",

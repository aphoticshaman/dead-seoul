Reaches up and touches your cheek—her fingers cold, wrong, already changing.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"You're a good girl, Yuna. Your parents would be proud.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She folds her hands in her lap. Faces the window. The burning city. Her burning home.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"Taehyun is waiting. I can almost see him.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You raise the gun. Your hand steadies. Strange, how calm comes when there's no other choice.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The sound is enormous in the small apartment. Then silence.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She looks peaceful. Finally. Free.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You stand there for a long moment. Then you take the car keys. The lockbox. The photograph of her and Taehyun, young and in love and alive, from the wall.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You owe her that much. To remember.</p>\n        ",

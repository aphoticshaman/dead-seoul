  "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">You search the apartment. Mrs. Park mentioned supplies—her husband's paranoia about the North. Emergency preparations that never got used.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Under the bed: the lockbox. Combination 1950. Inside: a Daewoo K5 pistol, three magazines, water purification tablets, a first aid kit, a compass.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Kitchen pantry: canned food, enough for a week. Rice. Dried noodles. A bottle of soju that looks older than you.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Hall closet: a hiking backpack, barely used. Rope. A flashlight. Batteries.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You pack everything you can carry. The backpack strains against your shoulders. The gun sits heavy on your hip.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park's apartment has given you everything you need to survive. Now you just have to survive.</p>",

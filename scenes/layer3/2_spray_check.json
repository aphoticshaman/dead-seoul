The cardigan is splattered with blood—Mr. Cho's, from the knife. Her hands shake slightly, but she examines them with clinical detachment.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"Nothing that won't bruise.\" She flexes her fingers. \"I was a nurse, you know. In the war. You learn what pain matters and what doesn't.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She looks at you. Really looks.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"You're the one I'm worried about. First time?\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She means killing.

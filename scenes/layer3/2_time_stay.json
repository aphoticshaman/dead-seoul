Something shifts in her expression—surprise, gratitude, and then a fierce, proud joy.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"You remind me of myself. Sixty years ago.\" She pats the chair beside her. \"Sit. We'll watch the world end together.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You sit. The city burns. Time passes in strange ways—minutes feeling like hours, hours like heartbeats.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She tells you stories. The war. Her husband. Her children who live in America now, who she'll never see again. She doesn't cry. Neither do you.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">When her hand starts to shake, when the veins in her arm turn black, she reaches for the revolver.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"It's time, dear. Will you—\" She swallows. \"Will you hold my hand? Just at the end?\"</p>\n        ",

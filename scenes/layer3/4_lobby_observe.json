There's a logic—primitive, but there. They follow sound. Movement. They cluster near fresh blood, then disperse when the feeding is done.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">They're faster than you expected. But they're not tireless. The ones that have been moving longest are slower, stumbling. The fresh ones—newly turned—sprint like athletes.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You count. Twelve in your immediate sightline. Maybe more beyond.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">A car alarm blares three blocks away. Eight of them snap toward the sound and run. The remaining four stay—older ones, or smarter. Harder to say.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The path clears. Partially. A window.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You have maybe thirty seconds before they wander back. Maybe less.</p>\n        ",

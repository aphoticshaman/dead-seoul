The absurdity of everything—the apocalypse, the neighbor you just killed, the eighty-three-year-old grandmother covered in blood and broken glass—it bubbles up and out before you can stop it.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park stares at you. Then she laughs too. A dry, crackling sound that turns into something real.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"When Taehyun died, I cried for a week.\" She wipes tears from her eyes—laughter tears now. \"When the world ends, I laugh with a stranger over a corpse. Fifty-four years of marriage didn't prepare me for this.\"</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The laughter fades. Reality settles back in. Mr. Cho is still dead on the floor. The city is still burning.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"dialogue\">\"Well.\" She smooths her cardigan. \"I suppose we should figure out what comes next.\"</p>\n        ",

You can't breathe.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You just killed a woman. An old woman. A kind woman who brought you soup and called you \"dear\" and remembered your birthday when your own mother forgot.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The tears come. Ugly, gasping sobs that shake your whole body. You press your face into your knees and scream into the fabric of your jeans.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">It takes a long time. Minutes. Hours. You don't know.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">When you look up, the fires have spread. The sky is darker. Night is coming.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park is still in her chair. Still peaceful. The apartment is quiet.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You pick up the gun. Check it. Three rounds left. You gather yourself, piece by piece, and stand.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You're alive. She wanted that. Honor it.</p>\n        ",

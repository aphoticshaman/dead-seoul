Still facing the wall. Lost in whatever hell they're experiencing.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You pass. Close enough to smell it—rot and copper and something sweet, sickly. Your stomach lurches.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Keep moving. Don't stop. Don't look.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Two more flights. Then the door to the lobby—or what's left of it.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The glass doors are shattered. The security desk is overturned. Blood—so much blood—painted across the marble floor in drag marks that lead outside.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Through the broken doors: the street. Hongdae. Your neighborhood for three years. Now unrecognizable.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Cars crashed into storefronts. Bodies in the road. And moving between them—things that used to be people. Hunting. Feeding. Waiting.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Minho said he was in Itaewon. Twenty minutes by foot. If the streets were empty. If the world was normal.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Neither of those things is true anymore.</p>",

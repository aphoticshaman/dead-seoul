The infection has taken everything—twisted her into something hunched and wrong. She's facing away from you, clawing at the wall, trying to reach a photograph that's just out of reach.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Her husband. The photograph. She's still trying to get to him.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She hears you. Turns. Her jaw unhinges, teeth clicking. But for just a moment—just a fraction of a second—her eyes clear. Human. Trapped.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You see her in there. Screaming. Begging.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The bat feels heavy in your hands.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You swing.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">It's not clean. It's not quiet. But it's done.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">She's still now. Finally still. The photograph is in her hand—you didn't notice before. She'd been holding it. The whole time.</p>\n        ",

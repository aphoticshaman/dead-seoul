Two young people in military uniforms, arms around each other, smiling at a future that seemed infinite.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Park Taehyun and Kim Soonhee. 1952. Incheon.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Their names are written on the back in faded ink. And below: <em>The day you said yes.</em></p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You tuck the photograph into your pocket. Next to your phone. Next to the only connection to the person who might still be looking for you.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park's apartment is quiet now. The scratching, the breathing, the wrongness—all gone. Just an old woman in her bed, finally at peace.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You should search the apartment. She mentioned supplies. An emergency kit. Something her husband left behind.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">But first, you pull the blanket over her. Cover what remains. Give her that dignity, at least.</p>",

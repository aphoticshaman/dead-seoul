Through the heart of the chaos.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You drive through things that used to be people. The bumps stop feeling like anything after the third one. The Hyundai's hood is streaked red and black.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Namsan Tower burns on the mountain. A beacon for the end of the world.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The roads narrow. Itaewon's famous streets—bars, clubs, restaurants that served fusion food to tourists—are now corridors of fire and broken glass.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Your phone buzzes. Still has signal. Still working.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">MINHO: where are you</p>\n            <p class=\"narrative\">MINHO: im at the hamilton hotel</p>\n            <p class=\"narrative\">MINHO: rooftop</p>\n            <p class=\"narrative\">MINHO: hurry</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The Hamilton Hotel. You can see it from here. Six blocks. The street is... dense. Bodies moving. Not all of them wrong. Some just running.</p>\n        ",

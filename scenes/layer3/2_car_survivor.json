Screaming something you can't hear over the engine.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Behind him—three, four, five of them, closing in.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">You slow. Just a little. See his face clearly now.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">Terrified. Crying. Human.</p>\n\n            <p class=\"narrative\">The first one reaches him. He stumbles, falls.

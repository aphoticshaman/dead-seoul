            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">The morning Seoul dies, you wake up late for work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your alarm didn't go off. Or maybe it did—maybe you slept through it, the way you've been sleeping through everything since Minho left. Six months of dreamless unconsciousness, your body's way of protecting you from the waking hours when you'd have to remember that he's gone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The apartment is cold. December cold, the kind that seeps through walls no matter how high you crank the ondol. You reach for your phone on the nightstand and the screen lights up with a violence that makes you wince.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Seventeen missed calls from an unknown number. Three from your mother—which is strange, because your mother never calls anymore, not since the fight about Minho, about your choices, about the way you've arranged your life like a museum exhibit: carefully curated, untouchable, alone. Two from your boss at the Leeum. One from a number you don't recognize.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And it's 10:47 AM. You were supposed to open the East Asian ceramics wing three hours ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You sit up. The movement sends blood rushing to your head, a pulse of vertigo that makes the room tilt. When was the last time you ate? Yesterday? The day before? The refrigerator has been empty for a week, but you keep forgetting to care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The television is on. You don't remember leaving it on. The news anchor is—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The news anchor is crying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You've never seen a news anchor cry. Not during the Sewol Ferry disaster. Not during the impeachment. Not during any of the small apocalypses that have punctuated Korean life for as long as you've been alive. But this woman—middle-aged, professional, her makeup running in dark tracks down her cheeks—is sobbing into her microphone while behind her, footage plays of something you can't quite process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">People running. That's the first thing you understand. People running through streets you recognize—Myeongdong, the shopping district, the place where you and Minho had your third date, where he bought you that ridiculous hat and you wore it anyway because he laughed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But they're not running like shoppers late for a sale. They're running like prey.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And behind them—</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"—advised to stay indoors. Do not approach anyone exhibiting symptoms. The infection spreads through—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Static. The image tears, fragments, reforms into a test pattern. The anchor's sobs cut off mid-breath.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stand. Your legs feel like they belong to someone else. The window—you should look out the window. See what's actually happening. See if this is real or if you're still dreaming, if the six months of numbness have finally cracked your mind open like an egg.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't look out the window.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Instead, you stand there in your ratty t-shirt and underwear, holding your phone like a lifeline, listening to the sounds filtering through the walls of your fifth-floor apartment. Someone screaming three floors up. A crash—glass, maybe, or furniture. A dog barking with the kind of sustained hysteria that means it's not going to stop. Car alarms. So many car alarms, layered on top of each other like a symphony of panic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your phone buzzes. Unknown number. Your thumb moves before your brain catches up, and suddenly there's a voice in your ear—a voice you'd recognize in a crowd of thousands, a voice that still appears in your dreams, saying words you can't remember when you wake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Yuna.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your breath stops. Actually stops, the air caught somewhere in your chest like a fist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Minho.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Six months of silence. Six months of blocked numbers and returned letters and the slow, grinding acceptance that whatever you had was over—not with a bang, but with the whimper of him taking a job in Tokyo and you staying behind, neither of you willing to say what needed to be said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And now his voice, rough with static and something else—fear, maybe, or exhaustion—asking:</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Where are you? Are you safe?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You open your mouth. Close it. The words feel impossibly far away, lodged somewhere in the frozen machinery of your throat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'm—I'm in my apartment. Minho, what's—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Listen to me.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">His voice has that edge it used to get when he was serious, when he stopped being the charming boy with the easy smile and became the soldier he'd trained to be for two years of mandatory service. The voice that could cut through panic. The voice that, once upon a time, made you feel safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Don't go outside. Barricade your door. Lock the windows. Don't open for anyone you don't know. I'm coming for you.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">A crash on his end. Glass shattering. Someone screaming—not words, just sound, the kind of sound humans make when language fails them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'm in Itaewon. I can be there in—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The line dies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stare at the phone. The screen shows CALL ENDED, the duration a flat 47 seconds. Less than a minute. Less than a minute to overturn six months of grief and silence, to hear his voice and feel that old familiar hook in your chest, the one that always pulled you toward him no matter how hard you tried to swim away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative thought\">He's coming for you. After everything. After the silence and the distance and the way he broke you like a falling star—brief and brilliant and beautiful, burning itself up to make someone else's wish come true at the cost of its own light.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative thought\">He's <em>coming for you</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Something moves through your chest. Hot. Complicated. You don't have time to name it—not love, not anger, not hope, just some tangled combination of all three that makes your hands shake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The pounding starts on Mrs. Park's door.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You hear it clearly through the thin apartment walls—not a knock, but a pounding. Rhythmic. Insistent. The kind of pounding that doesn't stop, that doesn't tire, that isn't asking permission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park is eighty-three years old. She makes kimchi jjigae every Sunday and brings you a bowl whether you want it or not. She's been widowed for fifteen years and she still sets a place at her table for her husband. She calls you \"dear\" and pretends not to notice when your eyes are red from crying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The pounding gets louder. Something splinters. Mrs. Park screams—not a scream of surprise, but a scream of terror, the kind that comes from the throat without the brain's permission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You're still holding the phone. Still standing in your underwear. Still frozen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho said to barricade the door. Minho said to stay inside. Minho, who is forty minutes away in Itaewon, who might not even make it through whatever is happening in those streets you glimpsed on the television.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But Mrs. Park is twenty feet away, and she's screaming, and the pounding has stopped which means whatever was on the other side of her door is now <em>inside</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have maybe thirty seconds to decide who you're going to be in this new world. The person who hides. The person who waits. Or the person who opens the door.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The fire extinguisher hangs on the wall by the kitchen. Heavy. Metal. Not a weapon, but close enough. In the drawer, there's a knife—the good one, the one you bought at Namdaemun Market because the ajumma swore it could cut through bone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park has stopped screaming. The silence is worse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">The hallway stretches forever. Twenty steps. Maybe thirty. Your feet are bare on the cold tile and you're still in your underwear and a t-shirt and none of that matters because Mrs. Park has stopped screaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The fire extinguisher is heavy in your hands. Red. Cold. The kind of weight that makes your arms ache after thirty seconds. You hold it like a club, like a promise, like the only thing standing between you and whatever is happening behind that splintering door.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The hallway lights flicker. Emergency power, maybe—the building's generator kicking in. Or maybe the grid is failing. You don't know. You don't care. All you know is that each step brings you closer to a door that's shaking in its frame, hinges screaming, cheap wood splintering around a lock that was never meant to hold against anything more determined than a gust of wind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You count the doors as you pass. 502—the young couple who fight every weekend and make up by Monday. 503—empty for months, the owner overseas. 504—Mr. Cho, the accountant who complains about your music and leaves passive-aggressive notes about recycling. His door is open. Just a crack. Just enough to see darkness inside, and something wet on the floor that catches the flickering light.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't stop. You can't stop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park's door gives just as you reach it. The wood around the deadbolt tears away in long splinters, and something pushes through—something that used to be human, that might still be wearing human clothes, but moves wrong. All wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's Mr. Cho.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You recognize the cardigan first. Brown wool, the one he wore every day, the one his wife bought him before she died. Then the hands—long fingers, accountant's hands, now curved into claws and streaked with something dark. Then the face.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">His jaw hangs loose. Not broken—<em>detached</em>, connected to his skull by strings of meat and tendon, swinging with each movement like a grotesque pendulum. His eyes are filmed over, milky white, but somehow they're tracking. Hunting. <em>Seeing</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The smell hits you like a physical force. Copper and rot and something else—something sweet, cloying, the smell of fruit left too long in the sun. Your stomach lurches. You swallow bile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Behind him, Mrs. Park is pressed against her kitchen counter. Blood on her hands—her own blood, you realize, from a wound on her arm that's still seeping through the kitchen towel she's pressed against it. A broken vase lies at her feet, ceramic shards scattered across the linoleum like fallen teeth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She's not screaming anymore. She's past screaming. Her eyes meet yours across the small apartment, and in them you see something you never expected from this woman who survived the war, who buried a husband and two children, who kept setting a place at her table for a man who'd been dead for fifteen years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You see hope.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mr. Cho turns. His head cocks at an angle that would be impossible for a living neck—forty-five degrees, maybe more, like a dog hearing a distant sound. His milky eyes find you. Fix on you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Recognition? Hunger? You'll never know which. Maybe there's no difference anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He takes a step toward you. Then another. His legs work wrong—stiff, jerky, like he's forgotten how knees are supposed to bend. But he's fast. Faster than he should be. Faster than a seventy-year-old accountant has any right to move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The fire extinguisher suddenly feels very small.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park is behind him. Cornered. If he turns back to her—if he finishes what he started—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your hands are shaking. Your whole body is shaking. But somewhere deep in your brain, past the fear and the nausea and the screaming animal instinct to run, something else is waking up. Something older. Something that knows, with absolute certainty, that you didn't come this far to watch an old woman die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mr. Cho is five feet away. Four. His jaw swings. His hands reach. His breath rattles through a throat that's half-collapsed, a wet gurgling sound that will haunt you for the rest of your life, however long or short that might be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have maybe two seconds to decide. The fire extinguisher in your hands. The trigger that could spray foam into his face. The weight that could cave in his skull.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Behind him, Mrs. Park is moving. You see it in your peripheral vision—the knife block on her counter, her bloody hand reaching for the biggest blade. But she's too slow. She's eighty-three years old and she's been bitten and she's <em>too slow</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Unless you buy her time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

            "layer": 1,
            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">You barricade the door.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The bookshelf goes first—heavy oak, inherited from your grandmother, the one she dragged across three provinces during the war because it held her mother's tea set and her father's poetry books. You've never moved it, not in three years of living here, and your arms scream as you shove it against the door. The tea set rattles. The poetry books spill. You don't care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Then the desk. Then the mattress. Then every piece of furniture that isn't bolted to the floor, piled against the door in a monument to fear that would be almost funny if you could remember how to laugh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The window faces the street. Five floors up. You could look—could see what's happening, could understand the scope of whatever this is—but you don't. You can't. The sounds are enough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Car alarms. Dozens of them. Screaming—human and otherwise. Glass shattering. Something that might be gunfire, far away. And beneath it all, a low, constant roar, like a stadium crowd or a wildfire or the collective panic of eight million people discovering that the world they knew is over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You sit with your back against the barricade. Your phone shows 23% battery. You've refreshed the news until it stopped loading, watched the little spinning circle go round and round until the connection died completely. The last update said the government was evacuating Gangnam. That was two hours ago. Or three. You're not sure anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Time stops meaning anything when the world ends.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho hasn't texted again. You've tried calling—seventeen times, each one going straight to voicemail, his recorded voice saying <em>\"This is Park Minho. Leave a message and I'll call you back.\"</em> Cheerful. Professional. The voice of a man who existed before today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You leave seven messages. The first is coherent. The seventh is just crying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park's apartment has been quiet for hours. You don't know what that means. You're afraid you do know what that means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">At some point, you fall asleep. You don't mean to—who sleeps through the apocalypse?—but your body makes the decision for you, dragging you down into darkness like a stone sinking into deep water.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You dream of Minho. The night before he left for Tokyo. The two of you on the rooftop of his building, sharing a bottle of soju, not talking about what was coming. His hand found yours. His eyes found yours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Come with me.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You wake to knocking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Not the frenzied pounding from before—the mindless, insistent hammering that came from Mrs. Park's door, from other doors, from everywhere at once. This is different. Three precise raps. Patient. <em>Human</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Yuna?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your heart stops. Actually stops, the muscle seizing in your chest for one eternal second before slamming back to life so hard you think you might throw up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Yuna, are you there?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">His voice. Through the door. Through the bookshelf and the desk and the mattress and all the barriers you've built to keep the world out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho is here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho, who was forty minutes away in Itaewon. Minho, who hasn't answered his phone in hours. Minho, who left you six months ago because Tokyo had opportunities and Seoul had only you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho is <em>here</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You scramble to your feet. Your hands find the bookshelf, ready to push, ready to tear down everything you've built because he came back, he actually came back, he—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The news said the infection spreads through bites. The news said the infected can look normal, at first. The news said—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The news said a lot of things before it went silent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Yuna?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">His voice sounds right. Sounds like him. But through a door, through walls, how can you be sure? How can you know that the thing on the other side is the man you loved and not something wearing his face?</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your phone is dead. You can't call him. Can't verify. Can't do anything but stand here with your hands on your grandmother's bookshelf, frozen between hope and terror.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

You arm up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The kitchen drawer sticks—it always sticks, you've been meaning to fix it for two years—but you yank it open with a violence that sends utensils scattering across the counter. Forks, spoons, the can opener you've used twice, and there, at the back, the knife. The good knife. The one you bought at Namdaemun Market three years ago because the ajumma swore on her grandmother's grave that the blade could cut through bone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You never tested that claim. You used it for vegetables, mostly. For the rare occasions when you cooked instead of ordering delivery. For the life of a museum curator in a modern city, where violence happened to other people in other places.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You hope she was telling the truth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Under the bed. The baseball bat from college. You never played—never even liked the sport—but you bought it after that night walking home from the subway, the man following too close, his footsteps matching yours for six blocks until you ducked into a convenience store and waited for an hour. The next day you bought the bat. Kept it under the bed. Told yourself you'd use it if you had to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The metal feels cold in your hands. Heavy. Real. The kind of weight that promises consequences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Front pocket: your phone. 34% battery. Signal flickering in and out like a dying heartbeat. Minho's last words playing on loop in your head: <em>I'm coming for you.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But Minho is in Itaewon. Forty minutes away on a good day, and today is not a good day. Today the streets are chaos and the phones are dying and the world has tilted on its axis in ways you don't understand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You can't wait for rescue. You won't.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stand at your front door. The baseball bat in your right hand, the knife sheathed at your hip in a belt you've repurposed from a leather jacket. You're wearing jeans, sneakers, a dark hoodie. Clothes you can run in. Clothes you can fight in. Clothes you can die in, if it comes to that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Behind the door: the hallway. Mrs. Park. The pounding that stopped ten minutes ago and the silence that came after, which is worse. So much worse. Because pounding means struggle, means someone's still fighting, but silence means—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't finish the thought. You take a breath. Then another. Then you open the door.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The hallway is empty. Almost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">At the far end, near the elevator, something is slumped against the wall. A body. Not moving. From here you can't tell if it's dead or undead or just unconscious, but the pool of dark liquid spreading beneath it suggests that whatever happened, it's over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The emergency lights cast everything in red. The flickering makes shadows jump, makes your heart jump, makes you see movement where there is none. You force yourself to look. To really look.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park's door is open. Just a crack. Enough to see darkness inside, to smell copper and rot drifting into the hallway like a warning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The stairwell door at the end of the hall hangs ajar. Beyond it: stairs going down to the lobby, to the streets, to whatever is happening out there. And stairs going up. To the roof. To high ground. To a view of the entire city.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have two choices. Down means facing whatever is in the streets. Minho is in Itaewon, northeast of here—if you're going to find him, you'll have to go through Seoul. Through whatever Seoul has become.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Up means information. The roof of your building has a clear sightline in every direction. You could see the scope of it. Understand what you're dealing with. Plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But up also means Mrs. Park. Means checking on the woman who's been feeding you for three years, who remembers your birthday, who sets a place at her table for a dead man.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The hallway stretches in both directions. The slumped figure by the elevator doesn't move. The silence is absolute except for distant sounds—screaming, sirens, something that might be helicopter rotors or might just be your imagination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

The sound travels through the walls, through the floor, through your bones. This place is dying. Slowly, but surely, the damage is spreading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You turn back. Check the hallway. Empty—for now. The flickering emergency lights cast everything in shades of red and shadow, and every shadow could be hiding something.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Options. You need options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The garbage chute at the end of the hall.

Every building has one, doesn't it? The window at the end of the hall—you've never opened it, never needed to, but beyond it there should be a metal ladder leading down. Or leading somewhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You approach the window. Peer through grimy glass. The fire escape is there—rusted, ancient, clinging to the building's facade like a dying vine. Below it: the alley. Dark. You can't see if anything's waiting down there. Can't know until you commit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Above you: the roof. The stairs going up might still be clear. And from the roof, you could see everything. Plan everything. Maybe find another way down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Or maybe find yourself trapped sixteen stories up with no way down except falling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The building groans again. Louder this time. Closer. Whatever structural damage started when things went wrong—when cars crashed into the lobby, when something exploded two floors below—it's spreading. You have hours, maybe.

            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">The stairwell swallows you whole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Fifteen floors. Thirty flights. Six hundred steps between you and Mrs. Park's blue Hyundai waiting in the B2 garage. You count them in your head as you descend—not because counting helps, but because if you don't count, you'll think about what you left behind. Who you left behind. The weight of her wedding ring on the chain around your neck, cold against your chest like a promise you're not sure you can keep.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The emergency lights flicker. Red, then nothing, then red again. Your phone flashlight cuts a narrow cone of reality into the darkness, and everything outside that cone might as well not exist. Might be full of them. Might be empty. You can't know. You can only move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Fourteenth floor. You pass a door hanging open, an apartment beyond it gutted by fire. The smell of smoke and cooked meat. You don't look. Don't stop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Twelfth floor. A child's shoe on the landing. Pink. Sparkles. You step around it like it's a land mine and keep going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Ninth floor. Something moving two flights down. You freeze, pressed against the wall, barely breathing. Your hand finds the grip of the pistol Mrs. Park gave you—the Daewoo K5, her husband's gun from the war, loaded with rounds that are older than you are. Three in the magazine. Three chances. After that, you have the knife and whatever violence you can manage with your bare hands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The sound stops. Whatever it was—an infected, a survivor, a rat—it moves on. You wait thirty heartbeats before you start moving again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Seventh floor. Sixth. Fifth. The numbers blur together. Your legs burn. Your lungs burn. Everything burns, but you keep going because the alternative is stopping, and if you stop, you'll think, and if you think—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You'll think about her face when she handed you the gun. The peace in it. The acceptance. The way she said <em>\"Thank you for not letting me die alone\"</em> like it was the greatest gift anyone had ever given her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You didn't let her die alone. But you did let her die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Third floor. Second. First. The lobby door is wedged open, and beyond it you can see chaos—overturned furniture, shattered glass, blood on the marble floor in patterns that suggest dragging. The security desk is empty. The building's front doors hang in their frames like broken teeth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't go that way. You keep descending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">B1. B2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The garage door creaks when you push it open. The sound is impossibly loud in the concrete cavern—echoing off pillars, bouncing off cars, announcing your presence to anything that might be listening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The garage is chaos. Crashed cars blocking the exit ramp. A delivery truck flipped on its side, spilling packages across the floor—someone's Christmas presents, someone's birthday gifts, things that mattered before the world ended. A child's car seat, buckled tight, empty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The blue Hyundai is there. Right where Mrs. Park said it would be. Untouched. Waiting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Between you and the car: three figures. Standing still. Not moving. Not breathing. Hunched over something on the ground, making wet sounds that you recognize from movies but never expected to hear in real life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Feeding sounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have three bullets. You have maybe fifty feet to cover. You have no idea how fast they can move, how loud the gunshots will echo, how many more of them might be hiding in the shadows between cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The Hyundai's keys are in your pocket. Mrs. Park's keys. Her husband's gun. Her daughter's number in your phone, waiting for a call that might never come.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You are alone. You are armed. You are more afraid than you've ever been in your life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

You wrapped it yourself, in her kitchen, with supplies from her first-aid kit. She didn't say anything while you worked. Didn't need to. You both know what a bite means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But she's not turning yet. However long she has—hours, maybe, or minutes—she's using it to help you escape.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"The Hyundai is in B2,\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">she says, not even winded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Taehyun's old parking spot.

Ninth floor. You stop with her, watching her face in the flickering emergency light.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"My daughter. Soojin. She lives in Busan. Here—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She presses something into your hand. A photograph, wallet-sized, worn at the edges. A woman in her fifties, smiling, with Mrs. Park's eyes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Tell her I wasn't afraid. Tell her I helped someone. Tell her—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Her voice breaks. For the first time since this started, she looks her age. Looks fragile. Looks like someone who knows she's saying goodbye.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Tell her I set a place for her father. Every night. Because love doesn't end when the person does.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't trust yourself to speak. You nod. Tuck the photograph into your pocket, next to your phone, next to everything else you're carrying from the world that was.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She takes a breath. Steadies herself. And then she's moving again—down the stairs, around the landing, into the darkness below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Seventh floor. Fifth. Third. The sounds from outside are getting louder—or maybe you're just getting closer to them. Car alarms. Screaming. Something heavy hitting something else, over and over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The garage door is ahead. B2. Mrs. Park's hand finds your arm, grips tight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"There will be things in there. There are always things in parking garages—I watch movies, I know.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She almost smiles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You have the gun?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have her husband's gun. Three bullets. You checked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'll distract them. You get to the car. Number 47.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"No. We go together—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Yuna.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Her voice is gentle. Final.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'm going to turn. Maybe in an hour. Maybe in ten minutes. I don't know. But when it happens, I don't want to be anywhere near you.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She squeezes your arm. Hard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Let me do this. Let me choose how it ends. For me. For Taehyun. For all the years I spent setting that extra place at the table.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The garage door looms ahead. Whatever is on the other side, you'll have to face it. Together, or alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

Sitting on the floor of your apartment with your backs against your grandmother's bookshelf, holding hands like teenagers at a movie, like nothing has changed, like everything has changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho's face is streaked with blood that isn't his. His shirt is torn at the shoulder where something grabbed him and missed. His hands shake when he's not holding yours, a fine tremor that he tries to hide and fails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He drove through hell to get here. Through Itaewon as it burned, through Hannam as it fell, through streets choked with cars and bodies and things that ran faster than cars should be able to hit them. He tells you about it in fragments, in half-sentences that trail off into silences that say more than words could.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He killed people. Things that used to be people. With his car. With a tire iron he found in the trunk. With his bare hands, once, when everything else failed. He doesn't look at you when he says that part.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I kept thinking about you,\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">he says, and his voice cracks on the last word.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Every time I had to—every time I did something I couldn't take back—I just kept thinking, <em>Yuna is waiting. Yuna is alive. Get to Yuna.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your throat is too tight to speak. You squeeze his hand instead. He squeezes back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I should have stayed,\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">he whispers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Six months ago. Tokyo was—it doesn't matter. I should have stayed. Should have asked you to come. Should have done anything except what I did.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You've imagined this conversation a thousand times. In the months after he left, you scripted what you'd say if you ever got the chance. The accusations. The questions. The pain you'd make him understand. But now, sitting here in your barricaded apartment while Seoul dies around you, none of those words seem to matter anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You came back.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">That's all you say. That's all there is to say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I came back.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Silence settles between you. Not uncomfortable—just heavy with things unsaid, with futures that might never happen, with a present that demands attention whether you're ready or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Outside, the sounds of the apocalypse continue. Screaming. Sirens. Helicopters somewhere distant. The constant, low roar of a city consuming itself. Your building has been quiet for hours, but that doesn't mean it's safe. Doesn't mean anything is safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho's car is parked three blocks away. He couldn't get closer—the streets were too crowded, too dangerous. But it's there. Waiting. A way out, if you can reach it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your neighbor, Mrs. Park—you don't know what happened to her. Her apartment has been quiet since you barricaded your door. You could check on her. Or you could go now, while the hallway is empty, before whatever is out there decides to try your door again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho looks at you. Really looks, for the first time since he walked through the door. His eyes are red, but clear. Something has settled in him. Something that was broken when he left is trying to find its pieces again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"What do you want to do?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He's asking you. After all this time, after all his grand plans and Tokyo dreams, he's asking you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

The truth of what we are.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't know what to say.

Maybe just because she's dying and she deserves to be heard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"We're not as civilized as we pretend. The veneer—manners, laws, social contracts—it's tissue paper. One crisis and it tears.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She points to a cluster of figures in the street below. Not infected. People. Fighting over something you can't see from here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"That started as a car accident. Fender bender. Now they're killing each other over a can of gasoline. No infection involved. Just people.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Her hand moves to another spot. A building on fire.

We built a world where heroism is a liability.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She turns to face you fully. Her legs still dangle over the edge, sixteen stories of nothing beneath her, but she doesn't seem to notice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"But you came up here. To check on a stranger. Why?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The question hangs in the air. You think about lying—saying you came for the view, for tactical information, for anything other than the truth. But she's dying, and she's earned honesty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I don't know. Instinct. Or... maybe because someone should.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She smiles. It's the first genuine expression you've seen on her face.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Hold onto that. That instinct. It's rarer than you think.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Her hand trembles. She looks at it—watches the tremor like a scientist observing an experiment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I don't have long. But I can give you something.

            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">Seoul is burning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stand on the roof of your apartment building—sixteen floors above the chaos—and watch your city die. The view should be beautiful. On any other day, you could see Namsan Tower from here, the Han River glittering in the distance, the endless sprawl of a metropolis that never sleeps. You've stood on this roof a hundred times, drinking soju with friends, watching fireworks on New Year's, trying to find peace in the vastness of it all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Now you're watching it end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Fires have spread through Mapo to the west. The smoke rises in columns that join together into a gray ceiling, blotting out the sun, turning noon into a perpetual twilight. Yeongdeungpo is worse—something exploded there, maybe a gas line, maybe something else, and the flames are visible even from this distance, a wall of orange that's consuming blocks at a time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Helicopters circle over Yeouido. Military. You can see them dropping something—supplies, maybe, or soldiers. Or maybe they're just watching, documenting the fall of a city that was supposed to last forever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">A plane spirals toward the Han River. Trailing smoke. Losing altitude. You watch it until it disappears behind the buildings of Gangnam, and then you hear the sound—distant, muffled, final. Someone's escape route just ended.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Below you, the streets are chaos given form. Cars piled against each other in intersections. Bodies—some moving, some not. People running, things chasing them, and from up here you can't tell who's winning because everyone looks so small, so insignificant, like ants in a colony that's been set on fire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Itaewon is to the northeast. You can see the hill, the old army base, the cluster of hotels and bars where expats used to party on weekends. Minho said he was there. Minho said he was coming. But the streets between here and there are filled with obstacles you can't navigate from a distance, and you have no idea if he made it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">If he's still alive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The wind up here is cold. It carries ash and the smell of burning and something else—something sweet, cloying, the smell you've learned to associate with them. With the infected. With what happens when the virus takes hold and the person you were dissolves into hunger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You're alone on the roof. Mostly. The water tanks loom behind you, rusted and ancient. The satellite dishes point toward a sky that's the wrong color. And near the edge, near the lip where sixteen stories of nothing separate the living from the dead—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">There's a woman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You didn't notice her at first. She's sitting still, legs dangling over the drop, white dress stained with something dark. From behind, she could be a statue. A ghost. A figment of a mind that's starting to crack under the weight of everything that's happened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But then she moves. Turns her head slightly. You see her profile—young, beautiful in the way that broken things sometimes are, tears tracking through soot and blood on her cheeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She knows you're there. She doesn't seem to care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The view from up here tells you everything you need to know. The city is falling. The streets are impassable. Every direction is danger and death and the slow collapse of everything you've ever known.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you also have information now. You can see the military helicopters over Yeouido—maybe an evacuation point. You can see the fires spreading in patterns that suggest wind direction, which means you know which way to avoid. You can see the darkness of the subway entrances, which might be safer than the streets. Or might be death traps. Or might be anything at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">What do you do?</p>",

Days, maybe. Time stopped meaning anything when the world ended, and now you're standing in an alley behind your building, looking at a city you don't recognize.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The street beyond the alley is chaos frozen in time. Abandoned cars. Broken glass. A bus tilted against a streetlight, its doors hanging open like a mouth mid-scream. Bodies—you don't look at the bodies. Can't look. The moment you start counting them is the moment you stop moving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have no car. No vehicle. Just your legs and whatever weapons you're carrying and the desperate hope that somewhere in this broken city, there's still a way out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Itaewon is northeast. Minho might be there. Might be alive. Might be waiting for you, or fighting, or dead in a street you'll never find.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Yeouido is west. The helicopters you saw from the rooftop. Military. Evacuation, maybe. Or just another false hope in a city full of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The Han River is south. Bridges. Escape routes.

He's waving both arms, screaming something you can't hear over the engine, over the chaos, over the blood pounding in your ears.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Behind him—three of them. Four. Five. Closing in. Running with that wrong gait, that hunger-driven sprint that's faster than any human should be able to move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You slow. Just a little. Just enough to see his face clearly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Terrified. Crying. <em>Human</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The first one reaches him. He stumbles, goes down hard on the asphalt, and you think <em>that's it, he's gone, nothing you can do</em>—but no. They run past him. Toward the car. Toward the noise. Toward you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He scrambles up. Sprints for your passenger door. His hand finds the handle, yanks, and the door doesn't open because you locked it, of course you locked it, because the world has rules now and one of them is <em>don't let strangers in your car</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">His eyes meet yours through the glass. Wide. Desperate. <em>Please.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have maybe two seconds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your thumb finds the unlock button. Click. He yanks the door open, throws himself inside, and you floor it before he's fully in—his legs still hanging out, door swinging, something grabbing at his shoe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He kicks. Screams. The shoe comes off but he's in, slamming the door just as teeth crack against the window hard enough to leave a web of fractures in the glass.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You drive. He pants. For a long moment, neither of you speaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The Hyundai accelerates through an intersection, clips a motorcycle, keeps going.

He's gripping the dashboard like it might disappear if he lets go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Thank you thank you thank—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Are you bit?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The words come out harder than you intended. But you need to know. You need to know right now, before he's been in this car for another minute, before you've driven another block, before the infection spreads because you were too polite to ask.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He freezes. Checks himself. Shirt. Arms. Legs. Neck. His hands are shaking so badly he can barely coordinate the movements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"No. I don't—no. I don't think so.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You glance at him. Really look. The blood on his shirt—not his. The tears in his clothes—fabric, not skin. The terror in his eyes—very human, very alive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'm Park Jungwoo.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He says it like an offering. Like giving you his name makes him real, makes this real, makes any of it make sense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I was supposed to get married next week.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">His voice breaks on the last word.

You have a passenger now—a stranger, a liability, a human being who might help you or might get you killed or might just be someone to talk to while the world ends.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He doesn't ask where you're going. Maybe he doesn't care. Maybe anywhere is better than where he was. Maybe he's just too broken to think that far ahead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have to choose a direction. With him watching.

            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">You don't see it coming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">One moment you're running—through the alley, toward the light at the other end, toward whatever passes for safety in this broken world. The next moment something hits you from behind, and you're falling, and the pavement rushes up to meet your face with a crack that splits your vision into stars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You try to get up. Your arms won't cooperate. Something's wrong with your shoulder—dislocated, maybe, or broken—and the pain is a white-hot scream that drowns out everything else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Almost everything else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The sound behind you. Wet. Eager. Hungry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You roll over. Look up. See them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Three. Maybe four. It's hard to count when they're moving, when they're reaching, when their mouths are already opening and their fingers are already clawing at your clothes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The first bite is the worst. Not because of the pain—though the pain is extraordinary, a tearing sensation in your calf that redefines everything you thought you knew about suffering. The worst part is the sound. Your own flesh, separating. Your own blood, hitting pavement. Your own voice, screaming words that might be prayers or curses or just noise, the kind of noise an animal makes when it knows it's dying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">They don't stop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You fight. Of course you fight. Your good arm swings, connects with something soft, sends one of them stumbling back. But there are more, always more, and your strength is leaving with your blood, pooling on the ground beneath you in a dark mirror of the sky above.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The second bite takes something important. You feel it go—a piece of you that won't grow back, that will never be whole again. If you live. If living is still possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's not. You know it's not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But the mind does strange things when the body is failing. It retreats. Detaches. Watches from somewhere outside, somewhere safe, as if this is happening to someone else. As if you're just a spectator at your own ending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You think about Minho. Wonder if he's still looking for you. Wonder if he'll ever know what happened, or if you'll just be another disappearance in a city full of them. Another name that stops being spoken because there's no one left to speak it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You think about Mrs. Park. Her kindness. Her kimchi jjigae. The way she kept setting a place for a dead man, as if love could bridge the gap between here and gone. You hope she's somewhere better now. You hope she's with Taehyun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You hope there's a somewhere to be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The third bite doesn't register as pain anymore. Your body has given up translating the damage into sensation. Everything is distant, muffled, like watching a movie with the sound turned low.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The sky is the wrong color. Gray and orange and something like purple at the edges where the sun is trying to set through the smoke. It's almost beautiful. If you could forget what's happening below it, you could almost call it beautiful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Your eyes close. Not by choice—the muscles just stop working, the commands from your brain getting lost somewhere in the wreckage of your nervous system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The last thing you feel is cold. Not the cold of December, but something deeper. Something final. The cold of a fire going out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You tried. That's something. In a world that stopped making sense, in a city that turned on itself, you tried to survive. You tried to help. You tried to find the people you loved and be found by them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It wasn't enough. But you tried.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The darkness comes. You let it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ending\">— DEVOURED —</p>\n<p class=\"ending\">Ending 20 of 13: Some stories don't have happy endings.</p>\n<p class=\"seed-display\">Your seed: [GENERATED]</p>",

            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">You drive south.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Away from Minho. Away from the helicopters and the maybe-evacuation and the streets where things hunt in packs. Away from everyone you've ever known, everyone you've ever loved, everyone who might still be fighting to survive in the city you called home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You tell yourself it's the smart choice. The logical choice. The choice that keeps you breathing when so many others have stopped. But somewhere deep in the hollow space where your heart used to be, you know the truth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You're running.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The bridges are chaos. The Hannam Bridge is blocked—a pile-up stretching back kilometers, cars abandoned, things moving between them like sharks in shallow water. You turn around, try the Banpo Bridge, find it worse. The Dongjak Bridge is burning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But the Noryangjin Bridge is clear. Somehow. Miraculously. A straight shot across the river to the highway that leads to—anywhere else. Anywhere that isn't here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You take it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The speedometer climbs. 60. 80. 100. The blue Hyundai wasn't built for speed, but it's trying, engine screaming, Mrs. Park's photograph sliding across the dashboard with every curve. You catch it. Tuck it into the sun visor where you can see it. Where she can watch over you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The city shrinks in the rearview mirror. The fires. The smoke. The helicopters that might be saving people or might just be watching them die. You don't look back. Can't look back. Looking back is the same as going back, and you can't—you <em>won't</em>—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The highway is empty enough to move. You weave between abandoned cars, between bodies that might still be moving if you look too closely, between the wreckage of a world that ended while most of it was still asleep.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Hours pass. The sun moves across a sky that's the wrong color. You stop once for gas—an abandoned station where the pumps still work, where you fill the tank and take every container you can find, where you don't look at the convenience store because something is moving inside and you don't have enough bullets for everything.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">By nightfall, you're in the mountains. A small road, barely paved, winding up into the Sobaeksan range. You find a cabin—empty, thank god, the owners fled or dead or somewhere in between. The door is unlocked. The pantry is stocked. The fireplace works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You barricade the doors. Check every window. Set up traps like you saw in a movie once, cans on strings, anything that might make noise if something tries to get in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And then you sit by the fire, alone, listening to the wind howl outside, wondering if Minho made it out. If anyone made it out. If survival means anything when you're the only one doing it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Days pass. Then weeks. The radio you find only brings static, then occasionally voices—military broadcasts, survivor camps, places you could go if you were brave enough to leave. You're not brave enough. You're not brave at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you're alive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Alive, and alone, and haunted by the choices you made and the people you left behind. Mrs. Park's ring weighs nothing on its chain around your neck, but somehow it gets heavier every day. The photograph in your pocket—her and Taehyun, young and in love—starts to feel like an accusation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You promised to survive. You kept that promise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You promised to tell her daughter about her. You never did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The winter comes. You have food. You have water. You have everything you need except the thing that made life worth living before the world ended.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have yourself. Just yourself. Forever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's enough. It has to be enough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's never going to be enough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ending\">— THE HERMIT —</p>\n<p class=\"ending\">Ending 7 of 13: You survived.

But because leaving means going somewhere, and you don't have anywhere to go anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho never made it out. You know this now. Confirmed by the lists they post every morning—the names of the confirmed dead, the names of the missing presumed gone. His name appeared on day twelve. You didn't cry. You'd already done your crying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you're not alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Jungwoo is here—the man you pulled into your car on that first terrible day, the almost-groom whose wedding never happened. His fiancée didn't make it either. You found each other in the meal line on day three, recognized the same hollow look in each other's eyes, and somehow started eating together. Then talking. Then just... being in the same space, because being alone felt worse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The professor's daughter found you on day eight. Dr. Yoon's daughter—twenty-six, studying abroad when it happened, flew back to Korea the moment the airports reopened. She came looking for anyone who might have seen her mother in those final hours. You had the keycard. You had the story. You gave her both.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She stayed. Partly for answers, partly because she didn't have anywhere else to go. Her name is Eunji, and she has her mother's eyes, and sometimes when she talks about philosophy you can hear the professor's voice echoing in her words.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Mrs. Park's daughter arrived on day fifteen. Soojin. You'd called her from the road, told her everything, and she'd driven up from Busan the moment the checkpoints opened. She brought her mother's old photo albums. You looked through them together—Mrs. Park as a young bride, as a new mother, as the woman who set a place for a dead man every night because love doesn't end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Soojin didn't blame you for surviving. Didn't ask why you made it when her mother didn't. Just hugged you and said <em>\"Thank you for being with her.\"</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She stayed too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">By the end of the first month, you have a corner of the convention center that's become something like home. Four cots pushed together. A curtain someone rigged from old bedsheets. A collection of photographs that grows every week—Mrs. Park and Taehyun, the professor at her lectern, Jungwoo's fiancée on what would have been their wedding day, Minho in his military uniform from years ago that his mother brought when she found you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You didn't choose each other. The apocalypse chose you for each other. But somehow, impossibly, it works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Jungwoo makes you laugh—dark humor, the kind that only makes sense when you've seen what you've seen. Eunji makes you think—philosophy over instant noodles, debates about what it means to survive, to choose, to keep going. Soojin makes you remember—her mother's stories, her mother's kindness, the legacy of a woman who spent her last moments making sure you had a chance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">When the government starts rebuilding, when they ask for volunteers to help reclaim the city, the four of you sign up together. Not because you're brave. Because you're stronger together than any of you are alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The first building you clear is your old apartment complex. Fifteen floors of memories, now empty, being swept for survivors and threats. When you reach Mrs. Park's door—still open, still dark—Soojin takes your hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Inside, everything is exactly as you remember. The broken vase. The blood on the floor. The kitchen where she handed you the gun and the keys and told you to survive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And on the table, undisturbed: two place settings. One for her. One for Taehyun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Soojin kneels down. Touches the chair where her father used to sit. When she looks up at you, she's crying, but she's also smiling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"She really did set it every night. I thought it was just something she said.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You help her gather her mother's things. The photographs. The tea set. The wedding ring, still on the dresser where Mrs. Park left it the morning she died. All of it goes into boxes, into cars, into the new home you're building together—the four of you, the found family, the survivors who found each other in the wreckage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's not the life you planned. It's not the future you imagined. But it's something. It's real. It's yours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And every night, in your new apartment—the one you share with people who understand—you set an extra place at the table.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">For Mrs. Park. For Minho. For everyone you lost and carry with you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Love doesn't end when the person does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You're learning what that means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ending\">— THE FOUND FAMILY —</p>\n<p class=\"ending\">Ending 5 of 13: They weren't the family you chose.

Bodies—some moving, some not—force detours that cost minutes you might not have. Twice you have to reverse, find another route, push through intersections that look impassable until you make them passable by force of will and accelerator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The Hyundai takes damage. A side mirror, lost to a collision with a motorcycle. A headlight, shattered against something you didn't see in time. The front bumper, hanging loose after you pushed through a barrier of shopping carts someone had erected across an alley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you keep moving. Toward Itaewon. Toward him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The Hamilton Hotel rises against the smoke-dark sky. Six stories. Rooftop bar where expats used to drink overpriced cocktails and pretend they were somewhere more exciting than Seoul. Now the windows are dark, some broken, and something is moving on the third floor—shadows against firelight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You park. The street is quiet—too quiet. The kind of quiet that means everything that could make noise has already been silenced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The hotel lobby is chaos. Overturned furniture. Blood on the marble. A concierge desk with a body slumped behind it, head at the wrong angle. You don't look too closely. You move through, toward the stairs, toward the roof.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Six flights. Each one could hide something. Each one could be the end. But you climb anyway, because Minho said rooftop, and Minho came back for you, and if there's even a chance—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The rooftop door is barricaded from the inside. You knock. Once. Twice. Three times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Minho?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Silence. Then—shuffling. Something being moved. The door opens a crack, and an eye appears. Wild. Terrified. <em>His</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Yuna?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The door flies open. He's there. Bloody, exhausted, holding a fire axe like he's been ready to use it, but <em>alive</em>. Alive and looking at you like you're a hallucination, like you can't possibly be real, like the world doesn't work this way anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You—I tried to come—the streets were—I couldn't—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He's crying. This man who never cried, who held everything in, who walked away from you rather than admit he was breaking—he's crying, and you're crying, and somehow you're holding each other on the rooftop of a hotel in a city that's dying around you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I found you.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You say it into his shoulder, into the blood and sweat and terror of him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I found you.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He pulls back. Looks at you. Really looks, the way he used to before Tokyo, before the distance, before everything went wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You came for me.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's not a question. It's wonder. It's gratitude. It's everything he couldn't say six months ago when he should have stayed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You came back for me first.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And then you're laughing, both of you, laughing at the absurdity of finding each other in the apocalypse, of all the ways this could have ended and didn't.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Seoul burns below you. The world you knew is over. Nothing will ever be the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you're together. And somehow, impossibly, that's enough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The helicopter comes at dawn. Military. Evacuating survivors from rooftops across the city. You wave, and it sees you, and within the hour you're lifting off—away from the fire, away from the death, away from everything except each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho holds your hand the entire flight. Doesn't let go. Won't let go. When the helicopter lands at the evacuation center in Pyeongtaek, when the medics check you over and pronounce you both uninfected, when the reality of survival finally sinks in—</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He still doesn't let go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'm not leaving again.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He says it like a vow. Like a promise. Like the words he should have said in an airport six months ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I know.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">And you do.

The woman in the photograph he's been clutching since you pulled him into the car, the woman whose name he couldn't stop saying, the woman he was supposed to marry next week in a ceremony that will never happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She's in the apartment where he said she'd be. Third floor. The one with the yellow curtains and the plants on the balcony. You find the door open, the lock broken, the apartment beyond silent in the way only death can be silent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Jungwoo doesn't scream. Doesn't cry. Just stands in the doorway, looking at what's left of his future, making a sound you've never heard a human being make before—something between a moan and a whimper, something that comes from a place beyond language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She's on the couch. Still. Peaceful, almost. Whatever happened was fast—you can tell from the way she's positioned, from the lack of defensive wounds, from the single bite on her neck that must have caught an artery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She didn't turn. Small mercy. The blood loss was too fast, the death too quick for the infection to take hold. Whatever she is now, she's not one of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Jungwoo walks to her. Kneels beside the couch. Takes her hand—cold now, stiff, not the hand he held on dates and proposals and all the moments that were supposed to lead to forever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I was supposed to protect you.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">His voice is hollow. Empty. The voice of a man who's already given up on everything except this moment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I was supposed to be here. I was at work. I was at WORK, and you—\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He breaks. Completely. Utterly. Sobs that rack his whole body, that shake the couch, that fill the apartment with grief so raw you can barely stand to witness it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You should leave. Give him privacy. Give him time to process what can't be processed, to grieve what can't be grieved. But you can't move. Can't look away. Can't do anything except stand in the doorway and feel your own losses echoing in his.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho might be dead too. You don't know. Might never know. Might spend the rest of your life wondering if you could have saved him, if you should have gone to Itaewon, if different choices would have led to different endings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Jungwoo stops crying eventually. Not because he's done—you can see he'll never be done, not really—but because the body runs out of tears eventually. Runs out of sounds. Runs out of everything except the hollow shell of a person who used to be whole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Go.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He doesn't look at you when he says it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I'm staying. With her. Until...\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He doesn't finish. Doesn't need to. You understand. Some endings aren't about survival. Some endings are about being there for the person you loved, even when being there means joining them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You leave him there. In the apartment with the yellow curtains. With the woman he was supposed to marry. With the future that was stolen before it could begin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The drive to the evacuation center is a blur. Tears and traffic and the constant weight of what you witnessed, what you couldn't prevent, what the world has become.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You survive. Of course you survive.

Hard. Harder than an eighty-three-year-old woman should be able to push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Go. GO.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You go. You get in the Hyundai. You start the engine. And in the rearview mirror, you watch her turn toward the things that were hunting you—the three infected who found you in the garage, who were closing in before she stepped between them and the car.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She has the knife from her kitchen. The big one. The one she used to cut vegetables for kimchi jjigae, to slice meat for bulgogi, to build all those meals she brought to your door because she knew you weren't eating properly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She's not running away. She's running toward them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't see what happens next. You're already accelerating, already taking the corner too fast, already escaping because that's what she wanted. What she demanded. The last gift she had to give.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The drive to the bridge is a blur. Tears and traffic and the constant awareness that you're alone now, really alone, in a way you've never been before. No Mrs. Park bringing you soup. No Minho calling at midnight. No one waiting at home with a place set at the table.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Just you. And her photograph. And the phone number of a daughter in Busan who doesn't know yet that her mother is gone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You make it out of Seoul. Through the checkpoint in Suwon. To the evacuation center in Pyeongtaek, where they check you for bites and give you a cot and tell you that you're safe now, as if safety means anything anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">On the third day, you call the number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Soojin answers on the second ring. Her voice is her mother's voice—warm, practical, the voice of a woman who expects bad news and has learned to receive it with grace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"She's gone, isn't she?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You tell her everything. About the pounding on the door. About Mr. Cho. About the bite that sealed her fate and the choice she made anyway—to help, to protect, to spend her last hours making sure a stranger survived.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Soojin listens. Cries. Laughs once, when you mention the kimchi jjigae.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"She was always feeding people. Couldn't stand to see anyone hungry.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You tell her about the photograph. About the message—<em>love doesn't end when the person does</em>. About the place at the table that her father occupied even fifteen years after he was gone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The silence that follows is full of grief. Full of love. Full of all the things that words can't carry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Thank you,\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Soojin says finally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"For being with her. For letting her go on her terms. For calling me.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stay on the phone until there's nothing left to say. Then longer. Then until Soojin has to go, has to keep living, has to start the long process of grieving a mother she wasn't there to save.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You hang up. Look at the photograph one more time. Two women—Mrs. Park and Soojin—smiling at the camera on some ordinary day before everything changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You survived because she chose to die. That's the math of it. The brutal equation of the new world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you'll carry her with you. Set a place at your own table, metaphorically speaking. Remember the woman who brought you soup and called you dear and spent her last moments making sure you had a chance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Love doesn't end when the person does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You're starting to understand what that means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ending\">— MRS.

Just a look. A nod. A hand reaching for yours, guiding it toward the gun at your hip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The tremors are getting worse. Her eyes keep flickering—human, then something else, then human again. She's fighting it. Has been fighting it since you met her on this rooftop, since she handed you the keycard and told you about the lab and gave you purpose when you had none.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But the fight is ending. You can see it. The way her fingers curl wrong. The way her breathing changes. The way she looks at you and for just a moment, just a fraction of a second, you see hunger instead of humanity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Please.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">One word. Barely a whisper. The last coherent thing she'll ever say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You raise the gun. The metal is warm from being pressed against your body. Heavy. Real. The weight of a choice you never wanted to make.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She smiles. It's the saddest smile you've ever seen—grateful and terrified and resigned all at once. The smile of someone who's made peace with an ending they can't escape.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Thank you,\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">she mouths. No sound. Just the shape of the words.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You pull the trigger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The sound is enormous. Bigger than you expected. It echoes across the rooftop, bounces off the water tanks, carries out over a city that's already full of gunshots and screams and the sounds of dying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She slumps. Peaceful. Human until the very end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stand there for a long time. Minutes. Maybe longer. The wind blows ash across the rooftop and the sun continues its slow descent through smoke-colored clouds and somewhere below you Seoul keeps dying, keeps burning, keeps becoming something unrecognizable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The keycard is still in your pocket. The lab she mentioned. The answers that might be waiting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you can't move. Can't think. Can't do anything except stare at the body of a woman whose name you never learned, whose last act was asking a stranger for mercy, whose final lecture was about the nature of humanity and whether any of it means anything when the veneer is stripped away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You gave her what she asked for. You don't know if that makes you a hero or a murderer or something in between.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The tremor starts in your hands. Then your arms. Then your whole body, shaking so hard you can barely stay upright. The gun slips from your fingers, clatters on the concrete, and suddenly you're on your knees, sobbing, breaking in ways you didn't know you could break.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stay like that until the sun sets. Until the cold becomes unbearable. Until some survival instinct kicks in and drags you to your feet and points you toward the stairwell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The lab can wait. The answers can wait. Right now, you just need to survive long enough to feel human again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You're not sure you ever will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ending\">— A MERCIFUL END —</p>\n<p class=\"ending\">Ending 24 of 13: Sometimes mercy is the hardest thing to give.</p>\n<p class=\"seed-display\">Your seed: [GENERATED]</p>",

            "content": "<p class=\"narrative\">You make it out together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The bridge is clear—barely, impossibly, a miracle of timing and luck and the desperate will to survive. Minho drives. You navigate. The Hyundai's engine screams as he pushes it past anything it was designed for, weaving between abandoned cars, over debris, through gaps that shouldn't exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Seoul shrinks in the rearview mirror. The fires. The smoke. The city that raised you, that held your memories, that was supposed to be forever. It's dying, and you're leaving it behind, and the grief will come later but right now there's only the road and the man beside you and the desperate need to keep moving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You don't stop until you're past Suwon. Until the checkpoints are behind you. Until the military waves you through with exhausted eyes and points you toward the evacuation centers and you realize, finally, that you're going to live.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The first night, you sleep in the car. Parked in a field off the highway, wrapped in emergency blankets, holding each other because neither of you can bear to let go. Minho cries. You cry. The kind of crying that empties you out and leaves something new in its place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I should have stayed,\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">he says, for the hundredth time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You came back.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"I should have never left.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You came back.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">That's the only answer that matters. The only answer you have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The evacuation center is chaos made orderly. Thousands of survivors, processed through tents, checked for bites, assigned cots in buildings that used to be schools and gyms and convention centers. You're together—they tried to separate you at first, men and women, but Minho held your hand and wouldn't let go and eventually they stopped trying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The days blur together. Waiting for news. Watching the lists of the dead grow longer. Learning that Mrs. Park's name appeared on day three, that your parents made it to Busan, that Minho's unit was wiped out in the first hours except for him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Survivor's guilt is a weight you carry together. Some days it's heavier than others. Some days you can barely get out of bed, and he holds you. Some days he can't speak, and you hold him. You take turns being strong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you're alive. Both of you. Together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">When the government starts rebuilding, when they ask for volunteers, you sign up together. Not because you're heroes—you're not, you're just two people who made it through—but because doing something is better than doing nothing. Because the dead would want you to keep going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You work in logistics. Minho works in security. You see each other at meals, at night, in the stolen moments between shifts. It's not romantic, most of the time. It's exhausted and scared and holding on to each other because letting go feels impossible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But sometimes—sometimes—there are moments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Three months in, on the rooftop of the building where you're both billeted, looking at stars you can finally see because there's no city light anymore, he asks you to marry him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">No ring. No speech. Just the question, raw and simple.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Will you?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You think about everything that led here. The phone call. The barricade. The choice to trust him when every instinct said not to. The six months of silence that almost cost you everything, and the apocalypse that gave you back to each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Yes.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You get married in the evacuation center chapel. A military chaplain. Witnesses you barely know. Clothes borrowed from the donation pile. It's nothing like the wedding you once imagined—the dress, the venue, the carefully planned reception.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's better. Because it's real. Because it's you and him and the promise of a future in a world that almost didn't have one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Seoul is reclaimed, eventually. Rebuilt, slowly. You go back—together—and stand in front of your old apartment building. It's empty now. Condemned. Slated for demolition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you remember. You both remember.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"This is where it started,\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">you say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"This is where we found each other again.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He takes your hand. Squeezes. The ring on your finger catches the light—a simple band, bought with ration coupons, worth more than any diamond could ever be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Let's go home.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Home is somewhere else now. Somewhere new. But home is also wherever he is, wherever you are together, wherever the two of you can build something from the ashes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You survived. Both of you. Together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">That's the only ending that matters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ending\">— THE SURVIVORS —</p>\n<p class=\"ending\">Ending 3 of 13: You found each other in the end of the world.

You don't remember when it happened. Which fight. Which scramble through which hallway. Which moment of not-quite-fast-enough.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But the bite is there. On your forearm, hidden under your sleeve for hours now. You saw it when you stopped to catch your breath, when you finally had a moment to check yourself, when the adrenaline faded enough for the pain to register.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's small. Almost nothing. A crescent of broken skin, barely bleeding, the kind of wound you'd put a bandage on and forget about in any other world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But this isn't any other world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You've been watching yourself for the past hour. Waiting for the symptoms you've heard about—the fever, the confusion, the hunger that replaces everything else. So far, nothing. Just the bite, and the knowledge of what it means, and the strange calm that comes from knowing the ending in advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The gun is in your lap. Mrs. Park's husband's gun. Two bullets left. You used one in the garage, putting down something that was blocking the car. You have one for yourself, when the time comes. And one spare, just in case you miss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You won't miss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The city below is beautiful in its destruction. Fires paint the clouds orange and red, like a sunset that goes on forever. The Han River reflects the flames, turning the water into something that looks almost alive. If you didn't know what was happening—if you could forget, just for a moment—you might think it was art.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You think about Minho. Wonder if he's still out there, still fighting, still looking for you. You hope he gave up. You hope he found another way out, another future that doesn't include finding your body on a rooftop with a gun in your hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You think about Mrs. Park. The way she smiled when she gave you the gun, like she was passing on something precious. The way she said <em>\"Survive\"</em> like it was a blessing and a command.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You tried. You really tried.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The first tremor hits as the sun touches the horizon. Just a shiver, really—a flutter in your hands that could be cold, could be fear, could be nothing. But you know. Deep down, in the part of yourself that's still human, you know what it means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The clock is ticking. You have minutes now. Maybe less.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You stand. Walk to the edge of the rooftop. Look down at the city—your city, the place where you were born, where you fell in love, where you thought you'd grow old. It's dying. You're dying. Everything is dying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But the sunset is beautiful. The air is cold and clean, up here above the smoke. And somewhere, somehow, there's still a world worth saving, even if you won't be part of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You raise the gun. The metal is warm from your hand. The weight is familiar now, almost comforting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The second tremor comes. Stronger. Your vision blurs at the edges, and for just a moment, you feel something new—a hunger, deep and vast, that has nothing to do with food. It's them. It's what they feel. It's what you're becoming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Not yet. Not yet. You're still you. Still Yuna. Still the woman who loved and lost and tried to survive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You close your eyes. Think of Minho's face. Think of Mrs. Park's kindness. Think of every good thing that ever happened, every moment that made life worth living.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Then you pull the trigger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The sound echoes across the rooftops. A single report, lost in the noise of a dying city. No one will hear it. No one will know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">But you stayed human until the end. That has to count for something.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ending\">— THE TURNING —</p>\n<p class=\"ending\">Ending 22 of 13: You chose how it ended.

The collective trauma of a city compressed into a canvas tent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You wait. You don't turn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">When they let you out, the sun is setting. The sky is red—partly sunset, partly fire. Seoul is still burning, but here, inside the perimeter, there's something like order. Something like hope.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">A woman in military uniform approaches. Colonel's insignia. Hard eyes.

In a civilian vehicle.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">It's not a question. It's an assessment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"We need people like you.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She leads you to a command tent. Radios crackle. Maps cover every surface, marked with red zones and black X's and arrows showing evacuation routes that may or may not still exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"We've lost contact with survivor groups across the city. Schools. Hospitals. Apartment complexes with people trapped on upper floors. We need someone who knows the streets. Who can guide rescue teams in.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">She hands you a headset. A map. A purpose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You'll be their eyes. Their voice. The person who gets them home.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You put on the headset. The radio crackles. Somewhere in the burning city, a rescue team is waiting for guidance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">This isn't what you planned. This isn't finding Minho, or escaping to the mountains, or any of the futures you imagined in those first terrifying hours. But it's something. It's helping. It's making the end of the world slightly less ended for the people still trapped in it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You key the radio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"Rescue One, this is Dispatch. I have your route. Turn left on Seongsan-ro, avoid the interchange—it's blocked. There's an alley between the coffee shop and the parking garage. Take it slow. I'll guide you through.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">The response crackles back. Grateful. Alive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You spend the next three weeks in that tent. Eighteen-hour days. Hundreds of rescue operations. Thousands of survivors guided to safety through streets you've memorized, through routes you've improvised, through a city that's slowly being reclaimed one block at a time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">Minho finds you on day nineteen. He made it to Pyeongtaek. Heard about the dispatcher who knew every street in Seoul. Put the pieces together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">When he walks into the command tent, you're mid-operation. Guiding a team through Gangnam. You hold up a finger—<em>one minute</em>—and he waits. He understands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">When the team is safe, when the radio goes quiet, you take off the headset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You found me.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"dialogue\">\"You were busy.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">He smiles. You smile. It's not the reunion you imagined. It's better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"narrative\">You have a job now. A purpose. A reason to survive beyond just surviving.
